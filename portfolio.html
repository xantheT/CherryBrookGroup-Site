						<span class="hidden-description">The Palomar Townhomes project represents the essence of transit oriented high density in-fill development. The Riding Group identified the site as a valuable residential property based on its proximity to the planned Vasona Corridor light rail extension and the Highway 17 corridor. And as anticipated the project completion will coincide with the completion of the light rail extension and adjacent station stop. The three and four story townhome buildings range from 1,352, to 1,775 square feet in size, in two and three bedroom models. All of the homes have direct private garage access with an overall project density of 26 units per acre.</span>

						<span class="hidden-description">
							The Sunnyvale Christian Community Church concluded that it was in its best interests to sell its three-acre property at South Mary Avenue and Iowa Street in Sunnyvale, California. The property included a sanctuary and  a school. The Riding Group successfully redeveloped the property with 34 unique carriage way homes that allowed front doors only on the street frontage with garage doors at the rear. The project design, which limited automobile access to the existing neighborhood, along with extensive neighborhood outreach resulted in positive neighborhood response to the project while sill achieving a higher density and affordable homes as requested by the City.
